## Our Story

PDX Empanadas was born as Empanadas Revolucionarias in 2011 in Worcester, Massachussets as a way to nurture the community of friends and family in our small town. In 2013 grew up into the business PDX Empanadas when we moved to Portland, Oregon to be closer to our kids and their families.  We started with a food cart in downtown and then moved to a permanent space at the Portland Saturday Market every Saturday and Sunday from March to December. On 2018 we were able to open a commercial kitchen with a lot more space than the food cart and we prepared it to offer frozen empanadas to grocery stores, cafes and restaurants.

PDX Empanadas is a family-owned and operated business with a passion for sustainable and healthy food. Our ingredients are organics as much as we can and come from local farmers and producers. We bake all our empanadas and try to offer vegan and vegetarian options all year.

## Poetry from Our Customers

```
Here comes Empanadas
Here comes Empanadas, right down Uruguay lane
Montevideo in downtown PDX, kneading on the grains

Hear those streetcar bells
Torres Garcia what a beautiful sight
Brave the showers on your lunch hour
'Cause Empanadas are a pastry delight

Plums and berries, raisins and herbs
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Empanadas are coming tonight
```
